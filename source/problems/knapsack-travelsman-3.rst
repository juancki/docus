Knapsack and Travel Salesman Combined Problem IV
================================================

Until now, we have presented the problem, a way to find an optimum solution using Breath First and a suboptimal solution with a heuristic function. 
In this article we are going to focus on the combinations and permutations of the solutions to this problem.

- Intra-subpath permuation
- Inter-subpath permuation

Intra-Subpath permutation
-------------------------
First off we are going to define the **subpath**. A subpath is any combination of picked elements between consecutive passes through the Origin. The special part about a subpath is that it always starts and ends at the Origin with the knapsack emtpy.
